# RPG Coursework Project
### Built in like 2 or 3 weeks

This isn't the most optimised thing I've ever made, mostly the fact that it's Java and with such short time constraint.
I might make something like this properly in the future in SFML or Unity, but that might be somewhat far off.

# Requirements
* Eclipse 2019-09 or Intellij IDEA
- A computer that has some form of graphics card as Java AWT runs on anything.
- Generation may be slow as it is not efficient in the slightest.
